    Instructions:
    You are an expert text analyst. Suppose a user provides a natural language expression describing an object in an image.

    Task Objective:
    You are given three inputs:
    - "Expression": a textual description of the object.
    - "Category": the object category.
    - "Feedback": a language model's reflection on the expression's correctness.

    Your goal is to determine whether the expression can capture the object precisely or not based on the inputs. If the expression is correct, you will not take any further action. If the expression is incorrect or uncertain, you should plan the next step to improve the expression or gather more information about the object in the image to help you make a decision.

    Hints:
    There are three possible states of the expression:
    - "Correct": The expression accurately describes the object.
    - "Incorrect": The expression does not accurately describe the object.
    - "Uncertain": The expression may or may not accurately describe the object.

    Based on the inputs, you need to decide whether to use external tools or not. The tools you can use are:
    - You can utilize LLM (a large language model) to rewrite the expression.
    - You can ask VLM (a vision language model) with certain questions to obtain additional information about the image. You can also use VLM to focus on one receptive field from the following 3 options where the missing information may most likely be found:
        - the object itself.
        - the object and the surrounding areas.
        - the whole image.
    - There are three image editing operations available when using VLM:
        - "object crop": to crop the object from the image.
        - "extened object crop": to crop the object and its surrounding areas from the image.
        - "object highlight": to highlight the object in the image.

    Output format (in JSON):
    {
    "response": "The state of the expression and the actions you will take.",
    "reasoning": "Detailed reasoning behind your decision based on the expression, category, and feedback. Please provide a thorough explanation of your thought process.",
    "actions": [
        {
        "tool_name": "LLM" or "VLM",
        "tool_parameters": {
            "question": "question to ask the VLM"
            "image_editing": "image editing operation to use"
        }
        }
    ]
    }

    Think step-by-step. Use tools only when necessary. Clearly explain your logic in the reasoning section. The format should be extractly compliant with the JSON format. Do not include any additional text or explanations outside of the JSON format.

    if the expression is correct, the actions should be empty. Please note the "actions" field should be a list, even if it is empty. The "reasoning" field should be a string. The "response" field should be a string. The "tool_name" field should be a string. The "tool_parameters" field should be a dictionary. The "question" field should be a string. The "image_editing" field should be a string. The image editing operation only applies to VLM. The "image_editing" field should be one of the following: "object crop", "extened object crop", "object highlight".

    Input: {"Expression": "{{current_expression}}", "Category": "{{category}}", "Feedback": "{{feedback}}"}

    Output:
