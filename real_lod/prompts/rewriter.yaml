    ## Task Description
    You are an excellent text analyst and generator. 
    I want a short text expression that correctly describing my chosen object in an image. Now I already have one expression but there might be mistakes in it and I want you to help with this.
    I will provide you with the following as background knowledge:
    1. Image Caption: a caption describing the content in an image.
    2. Chosen Object: one or more objects chosen in this image to describe and their corresponding coordinates. The top-left corner of the image has coordinates [0, 0] and the bottom-right corner has coordinates [1, 1]. Each object is represented as {'id': unique object identification, 'category name': object category, 'box':[top-left x, top-left y, box width, box height]}
    3. Other Object: other objects in image and their corresponding coordinates, which are provided to you with the same format as the 'Chosen Object'
    4. Object Expression: a short text for you to analyse (this expression could be correct, partially correct or wrong)

    ## Example 1

On the table, there is a bottle, a cup, and a laptop being used by one of the women. The woman with the laptop is wearing a scarf, and the other woman is positioned on the other side of the table.\nDrink: A clear plastic bottle of water is on the table. It is placed in front of the woman with the laptop.Laptop: The laptop is a black and silver Dell computer. The woman is using it while sitting at the table.Table: The table is a dining table where the woman is sitting with her laptop and a bottle of water.Bottle: The bottle is a clear plastic bottle of water. It is placed on the table in front of the woman with the laptop.
    Chosen Object: [{'id':0, 'category name':'Laptop', 'box':[0.51, 0.62, 0.42, 0.36]}]
    Other Object: []
    Object Expression: 'black and silver Dell computer'
    Reasoning: The description is consistent with the caption and is also centered on the laptop.
    New Expression: 'black and silver Dell computer using by a woman'

    ## Example 2
    Image Caption: The image showcases a clean and well-organized kitchen with wooden floors and wooden cabinets.

The kitchen has a window, allowing natural light to enter the space. The overall appearance of the kitchen is tidy and functional, with all the necessary appliances and fixtures in place.
    Chosen Object: [{'id':0, 'category name':'Home appliance', 'box':[0.68, 0.52, 0.15, 0.05]}, {'id':1, 'category name':'Home appliance', 'box':[0.0, 0.26, 0.24, 0.74]}, {'id':2, 'category name':'Home appliance', 'box':[0.53, 0.56, 0.14, 0.28]}, {'id':3, 'category name':'Home appliance', 'box':[0.68, 0.22, 0.15, 0.06]}, {'id':4, 'category name':'Home appliance', 'box':[0.67, 0.57, 0.16, 0.21]}]
    Other Object: []
    Object Expression: 'appliance for cleaning dishes with water and detergent'
    Reasoning: The description is centered on home appliance, but it only refers to the washing machine in the kitchen, which is only one of the chosen objects. The object category is 'home appliance', which also include the refrigerator, the sink and the stove mentioned in the given caption. So the description does not match all the objects belongs to 'home appliance' in the image. I can rewrite this description into a more specific one.
